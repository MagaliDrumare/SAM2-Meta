# SAM2-Meta
Our latest model, SAM 2, is the first unified model for real-time, promptable object segmentation in images and videos, enabling a step-change in the video segmentation experience and seamless use across image and video applications. SAM 2 exceeds previous capabilities in image segmentation accuracy and achieves better video segmentation performance than existing work, while requiring three times less interaction time. SAM 2 can also segment any object in any video or image (commonly described as zero-shot generalization), which means that it can be applied to previously unseen visual content without custom adaptation.
